getboottime()
	- needs  G_ and V_ variant and applied correctly in the right places.
	- failed/xdr
	- xhr,  sys/sys/time.h

_SYSCTL_ROOT_NODE
hostid?

failed/xej	sysv_msg ... skipped
	xja -> msg_prison_slot
failed/xek	sysv_sem ... skipped
	xja -> sem_prison_slot
failed/xel	sysy_shm ... skipped
	vps_dump_sysvshm_shminfo -> needs the extra prison field.
	}}} all three need proper OSD save/restore if we keep it?

xes -> vfs_cache.c needs review;  just applied blindly so far.

Lots of &prison0 vs. V_prison0  (no &)  but only in some places;  check that!

failed/xfx	vnet.h changes *ouch*

TDF2_*		need field editing all over the place.  Not enough spares anymore.
