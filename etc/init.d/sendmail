# This script is used by /etc/rc at boot time to start sendmail.  It
# is meant to be sendmail specific and not a generic script for all
# MTAs.  It is only called by /etc/rc if the rc.conf mta_start_script is
# set to /etc/rc.sendmail.  This provides the opportunity for other MTAs
# to provide their own startup script.

# The script is also used by /etc/mail/Makefile to enable the
# start/stop/restart targets.

# The source for the script can be found in src/etc/sendmail/rc.sendmail.
